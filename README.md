# Web Application Testing with Cypress and TypeScript

This project is an **end-to-end** testing framework built with **Cypress** and **TypeScript**, following the **Page Object Model** (POM) design pattern. It automates browser interactions to ensure the functionality and user experience of web applications are working as expected. The use of POM helps in making the test code more maintainable, reusable, and scalable, as each page’s elements and actions are encapsulated in separate page objects.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
CYPRESS-TS/
│
├── cypress/                   # Cypress test folder
│   ├── downloads/             # Files downloaded during tests
│   ├── e2e/                   # End-to-end test files
│   │   └── spec.cy.ts         # Example test written in TypeScript
│   ├── fixtures/              # Mock data for tests (e.g., JSON)
│   ├── support/               # Custom commands, test setup
│
├── node_modules/              # Installed dependencies
├── cypress.config.ts          # Cypress configuration file
├── package.json               # Project dependencies and scripts
├── package-lock.json          # Lock file for dependencies
├── tsconfig.json              # TypeScript configuration file
```

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the repository

If you haven't already cloned the repository, run the following command:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install **Cypress**, **TypeScript**, and other necessary dependencies defined in `package.json`.

## Configuration

This project uses **TypeScript** and **Cypress** together for end-to-end testing. The configuration files are:

- **`cypress.config.ts`**: The configuration for Cypress settings (e.g., base URLs, timeouts).
- **`tsconfig.json`**: The TypeScript configuration to ensure the proper compilation of TypeScript files in the project.

## Running the Tests

### Open Cypress Test Runner

To run the tests in the Cypress UI, use the following command:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

This will open the Cypress Test Runner, where you can select and run your tests interactively.

### Run Tests Headlessly

To run the tests in a headless browser (without the UI), run:

```bash
npx cypress run
```

This will execute all the tests and display the results in the terminal.

## Writing Tests

Tests are located inside the `cypress/e2e/` folder. Each test file is written in **TypeScript** with the `.cy.ts` extension.

Example of a simple test (`firstExample.cy.ts`):

```typescript
describe("My First Test", () => {
  it("Should visit the website and check title", () => {
    cy.visit("https://example.com");
    cy.title().should("include", "Example");
  });
});
```

## Custom Commands

You can add custom commands for reusable test functionality. Custom commands are located in the `cypress/support/` folder, where you can create new commands in `commands.ts` or configure the test setup.

Example of adding a custom login command (`commands.ts`):

```typescript
Cypress.Commands.add("login", (email: string, password: string) => {
  cy.get('input[name="email"]').type(email);
  cy.get('input[name="password"]').type(password);
  cy.get('button[type="submit"]').click();
});
```
